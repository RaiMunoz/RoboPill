# RoboPill
Robopill is controlled through an Android application that sets a schedule for dispensing of pills and logs when the pills are taken by the patient to assist patients with adhering to their medication schedule.  The application pairs to the bluetooth module of the Arduino, sending the Bytestream either by command or via the scheduler.  The Arduino listens and receives a byte stream, triggering the correct servo to dispense the needed pill.  The Arduino also drives an infrared sensor that detects when the pill is dispensed and when the pill is taken and drives an LED screen and LED lights to notify the person whether or not they have taken the medication.
